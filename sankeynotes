Problem:
Python - TypeError: Object of type 'int64' is not JSON serializable

Why? We are passing a pandas df and "json does not recognize NumPy data types". Ref:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50916422/python-typeerror-object-of-type-int64-is-not-json-serializable

Best solution seems to be to convert numpy datatypes to regular numbers. Note that the SO accepted solutions converts to int but we clearly need int, float, or whatever is in there, so let's take a more structural solution. See this:

So we do:

- install numpyencoder
sankey_date.py -> 

at top
from numpyencoder import NumpyEncoder 

line 58
json.dump(data, f, cls=NumpyEncoder)

Next problem is converting json

Install npm on production machine.
