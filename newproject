Example: new project called stocks

sudo docker exec -it moc_web python manage.py startapp stocks
remove models.py file and migrations directory

Then copy a URLs file and put in the directory
Edit the urls and put
app_name = "stocks"

Adjust the URLs to suit your needs

------------------

In the admin section, add a new project and enter the details
Under slug, enter the word to use as subdomain/subfolder, eg 'stocks'
In settings.py > PROJECT_ID_LIST add the id and slug
Add it under PROJECT_LIST as well

--------

ie/urls_PROJECTNAME.py -> create this file, copy from other
