<h1>About AHP</h1>

<h2>What Is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)?</h2>

<p>
OPTamos is a tool that uses the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to support
evaluation of options for participatory transformation and management of
sustainable land use. AHP is a structured decision-making methodology used to
evaluate complex choices involving multiple criteria. Developed by Thomas L.
Saaty, AHP helps individuals and groups make decisions by breaking them down
into smaller, more manageable comparisons.
</p>

<p>
Rather than forcing users to assign absolute scores, AHP relies on pairwise
comparisons—asking how much more one option or criterion matters relative to
another. These comparisons are then translated into priority weights that
reflect overall preferences in a transparent and mathematically consistent way.
</p>

<p>
AHP is widely used in fields such as strategic planning, resource allocation,
policy analysis, product selection, and risk assessment.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-10">Structuring a Decision with AHP</h2>

<p>
AHP organizes a decision problem into a hierarchy with multiple levels:
</p>

<ul class="mb-5 list-disc pl-8">
  <li><strong>Goal</strong> – the decision you are trying to make</li>
  <li><strong>Criteria</strong> – the factors that influence the decision</li>
  <li><strong>Alternatives</strong> – the options being evaluated</li>
</ul>

<p>
  This hierarchical structure ensures that all relevant factors are considered
  and clearly related to the overall goal. It also makes complex decisions easier
  to communicate and review.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-10">Pairwise Comparisons and Preference Scales</h2>

<p>
At the core of AHP is pairwise comparison. Instead of evaluating many items at
once, users compare two elements at a time and indicate which is preferred and
by how much.
</p>

<p>
AHP typically uses a 1–9 scale to express preference strength:
</p>

<ul class="mb-5 list-disc pl-8">
<li>1 indicates equal importance</li>
<li>Higher values indicate stronger preference of one element over another</li>
</ul>

<p>
These comparisons form a comparison matrix, from which priority weights are
calculated. The reciprocal nature of comparisons ensures internal consistency
and logical coherence.
</p>

<h2 class="mt-10">Consistency and Decision Quality</h2>

<p>
AHP includes a built-in mechanism to measure consistency in judgments. Because
human judgments are not always perfectly logical, AHP calculates a Consistency
Ratio (CR) to indicate whether the comparisons are reasonably consistent.
</p>

<p>The Consistency Ratio:</p>

<ul class="mb-5 list-disc pl-8">
  <li>Improves decision reliability</li>
  <li>Highlights contradictory judgments</li>
  <li>Encourages thoughtful review rather than blind scoring</li>
</ul>

<p>
By combining structure, mathematical rigor, and human judgment, AHP produces
decisions that are both analytically sound and intuitively defensible.
