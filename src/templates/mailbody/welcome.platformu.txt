If you have any suggestions to improve the functionality of the site, add a new work item to the list.

The platform has been developed and is hosted by the Metabolism of Cities team. Our goal is to make cities more resource efficient places to live and work by improving data and knowledge of how cities work.  For more information the non-for-profit organisation, head to www.metabolismofcities.org.
