Familiarise yourself with Sass
==============================

Sass is a rather simple but also very useful CSS extension. It makes writing CSS easier.

https://sass-lang.com/guide
- A basic overview. The most important features to understand for MoC are variables and nesting. Because we use the Sass version of Bootstrap, you will also encounter many partials.

Current .scss file used for new design: /static/css/main.scss
- Notice the nesting of styles.

Please also take a look at the scss files for bootstrap: /static/css/bootstrap/
- You can see examples of variables in _variables.scss and how they're used in most other files, for examples _buttons.scss.

One of Sass' features I haven't used yet is extend/inheritance as I didn't know it existed! It would have been very useful for a number of projects and I think we can use it for MoC as well. I need to learn this too, so we can figure out how it works together.

As a last note: MoC will use the SCSS style (.scss as opposed to .sass). Not super important to know the differences, the main thing to know is that we're using the SCSS style. See this link for more info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5654447/whats-the-difference-between-scss-and-sass


Initial tasks
=============

# Footer(s)
There are two footers. It would be useful for one to have basically a list of all the pages; the navbar but everything visible automatically. The second footer should have the logo, contact information, and a link to MoI.

# Buttons with images
For a city's resources / sectors (see https://metabolismofcities.org/cities/cape-town) we'll need nice looking buttons with an image as background, like the ones on the Resource Watch homepage under "Featured dashboards".

# Tables
MoC has many tables and uses something called Data Tables (https://datatables.net/). It would be great if these better fit in with the style of the new design. I know from experience this is a bit of a pain. See: https://datatables.net/manual/styling/

# Contribute message
Many pages (such as https://metabolismofcities.org/community/research/projects) have an orange "Contribute" box. These would ideally be in a seperate file so it can be used as a template and fit in with the new design.

# Cards
The Bootstrap cards are fine (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/card/), but it would be great if the default card would be styled closer to Resource Watch's cards, like here: https://resourcewatch.org/data/explore

# Images on city profile pages
On a city's page on MoC, there are a number of thumbnails for photos (see bottom of https://metabolismofcities.org/cities/cape-town/). I'd like to create squared


Software suggestion: Zeal
=========================

A programme I use a lot is Zeal: https://zealdocs.org/

It's offline documentation for a large number of languages / libraries, including most (all?) of the ones used for MoC.

Page elements
=============

Virtually every page will have a few common elements.



Other common elements include:
- Tables
- Buttons

- Vertical navigation (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/components/navs/#vertical)
- Navbar for single city


Page types
==========

Though a few pages are unique, many others are of a recurring type.
- City overview page (https://metabolismofcities.org/cities/cape-town/)
- City > single sector page (https://metabolismofcities.org/cities/cape-town/sectors/agriculture/)
- Single dataset page (https://metabolismofcities.org/cities/cape-town/datasets/58/)
- Single journal article page (https://metabolismofcities.org/resources/publications/1100)
- Single news article page (https://metabolismofcities.org/community/news/226)
- Single person (https://metabolismofcities.org/community/people/593)
- Single thesis (https://metabolismofcities.org/community/research/theses/67)
- Single event (https://metabolismofcities.org/community/events/196)
